1. Navigate to <https://fllmad01chatuica.orangeisland-5b7e94c0.southcentralus.azurecontainerapps.io>
2. Select **Sign in**.

4. Select **Next**, enter your provided password at the prompt, then select **Sign in**.

5. **VERY IMPORTANT!** If you are prompted to download and set up the Microsoft Authenticator app within an Action Required dialog, select **Ask later**. Please **do not** set up multi-factor authentication with this account.

6. The user portal appears with an empty chat history (1), input box for asking questions to the agent (2), and an agent select list (3) that lets you select either the default agent or the private anomaly agent that you will configure (more on this in a bit).
