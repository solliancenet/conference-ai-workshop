# conference-ai-workshop
Repo for the DEVintersection/Microsoft Azure + AI conference After Dark AI workshop hosted by Solliance.

Notes:

- Roll out FLLM deployment with files that are vectorized
- Challenge for working with the prompts
- We would create 100 agents with 100 prompt files in storage
  - Users can edit their agent and play with prompts to test different options
  - Set up agent hints with student ID
- Create Azure AD tenant with User1 - 100
- 30 minutes of intros to explain the environment, etc.
- Think of three categories of files we vectorize (San Diego, etc.)
- Challenges:
  - Who gets the coolest answers to these questions (what was cool about Elephant Valley in SD Zoo, etc.) - as poems, etc.
  - Play with user prompts
  - Play with a selection of data sources
- Prizes for funniest, best hallucination, etc.
- Show them the files and tell them they are pre-vectorized. Everyone starts from the same condition where those who know how to vectorize don't have an advantage
- Switch on and off indexes for agents, etc.
- Create synthetic data on visitors to the zoo exhibits, etc., including demographics, and have agents that access the journal as well as this data to answer questions
- Start exploring hybrid scenarios across data source patterns
