# AI After Dark workshop hosted by Solliance

Thank you for attending our AI After Dark workshop. We have a fun evening planned of learning, food, drinks, games, prizes, and networking.

The purpose of this workshop is to teach you about large language models (LLMs) and how to use them along with your own data to analyze and explore the data through natural language prompts. As you can imagine, there is a lot of infrastructure and work that goes into enabling this process flow. We will kick the night off with a presentation that describes the concepts and architectural components that enables this capability. Then we'll dive into the interactive portion of the workshop that lets you experiment with prompt engineering that drives the way a GPT LLM accesses and analyzes data stored in a SQL database to provide responses to questions that you ask it in order to find anomalies. Fortunately, we make it easy for you by providing a ready-made infrastructure that handles the complexities of this interaction. This infrastructure is provided by [FoundationaLLM](https://foundationallm.ai).

FoundationaLLM is a platform for building custom copilots that simplify and streamline knowledge management and analytic processes across your enterprise. It integrates with enterprise data sources and provides fine-grain security controls to guard against attacks. The solution is scalable and extensible to new data sources and orchestrators. It has been hardened against attacks by an LLM red team from inception.
